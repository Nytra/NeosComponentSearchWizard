# NeosLogixCleanupWizard

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that provides a wizard for cleaning up leftover logix components.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
2. Place [NeosLogixCleanup.dll](https://github.com/XDelta/NeosLogixCleanupWizard/releases/latest/download/NeosLogixCleanupWizard.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.

## Usage
The wizard can be found in the DevTip 'Create New' menu under Editors/LogiX Cleanup. <br>
I'd **Strongly recommend** saving a backup before using any functions of this mod and testing functionality after.<br>
