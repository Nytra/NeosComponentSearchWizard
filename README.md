# ComponentWizard

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that provides a wizard for searching for components by type or by string matching and then batch enabling, disabling or destroying them.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
2. Place [NeosLogixCleanup.dll](https://github.com/XDelta/NeosLogixCleanupWizard/releases/latest/download/NeosLogixCleanupWizard.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.

## Usage
The wizard can be found in the DevTip 'Create New' menu under Editors/Component Wizard (Mod). <br>
This mod should be used carefully as it allows changing a large number of components at once.<br>
